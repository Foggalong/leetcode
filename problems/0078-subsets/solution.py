"""
It was odd that this problem came up today, because I used the powerset
recipe from the itertools module to do yesterday's Daily LeetCode. This
is included as `powerset` below. Today's solution was also started at a
time long past, so I finished that rather than starting anew. It is for
sure not the best way to do this.

EDIT (May 23rd) also added an implementation of the binary filtering I
saw someone discuss in the comments because it piqued my interest.
