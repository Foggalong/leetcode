# Daily Programmer Solutions
There's a brilliant subreddit [r/dailyprogrammer](https://reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer) which releases several coding challenges every week. A list of the challenges can be found [here](https://git.fogg.me.uk/Foggalong/daily/src/master/CHALLENGES.md) in a nicer format than provided by the subreddit.

This repo contains my solutions to those challenges in a variety of languages that I know or am in the process of learning. While by no means perfect, they're hosted here as a possibly useful reference for future projects.
